# Measurements

This folder contains a collection of measurements associated with the thesis "Implementing Spiking Neural Networks on NPU-Equipped Microcontroller"


## Structure


```text
/ Measurements /
├── README.md
├── NPU_Measurements
└── CPU_Measurements
```

NPU_Measurements and CPU_Measurements contain results for each respective implementation in .stpm format.

## Usage

The .stpm format can be opened using the STM32CubeMonitor-Power tool. Alternatively, the files can be opened with a zip tool to extract csv files.
